# Xcode Low Key Syntax Theme

An Atom theme using Xcode's Low Key color palette. There's also a
[version of this theme](https://github.com/dgraham/xcode-low-key-vim) for Vim.

This theme can be installed in Atom by going to the _Themes_ section in the
Settings view (`cmd-,`). Then activate it by selecting it from the
_Syntax Themes_ drop-down menu.

This syntax theme complements the [Unity UI](https://github.com/orderedlist/unity-ui) theme for a native OS X appearance.
